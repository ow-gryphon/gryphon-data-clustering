# Data clustering template - Gryphon

This template provides data clustering capabilities, adapted from OW's Sphinx tool: https://owlabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SQUADSPHINX/overview

Currently, this provides K-Means capabilities. It can (and will soon) be easily extended to other Sklearn clustering methods. See the worked example:
